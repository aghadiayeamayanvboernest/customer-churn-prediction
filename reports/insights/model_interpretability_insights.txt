--- Model Interpretability Insights ---
This report summarizes the key drivers of customer churn based on our models.


--- Logistic Regression Insights ---

Top 3 features INCREASING churn risk:
  - services_count (Coefficient: 0.67)
  - InternetService (Coefficient: 0.45)
  - internet_no_techsupport (Coefficient: 0.45)

Top 3 features DECREASING churn risk (promoting retention):
  - tenure (Coefficient: -0.87)
  - ExpectedTenure (Coefficient: -0.43)
  - Contract (Coefficient: -0.43)


--- Tree Model (Random Forest/XGBoost) Insights ---
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide a unified measure of feature importance for tree models.
Key takeaways from SHAP plots:
  - Feature Importance (Bar Plot): Shows the average impact of each feature on model output magnitude.
  - Summary Plot (Dot Plot): Reveals not just the importance, but also the direction and distribution of effects.
  - Positive SHAP values indicate a push towards churn; negative values signal a push towards retention.


--- General Recommendations ---
1. Focus retention efforts on customers exhibiting characteristics of the top churn-driving features.
2. Leverage insights from retention-driving features to inform marketing and customer success strategies.
3. Use these insights in the Streamlit dashboard to provide transparent, per-customer predictions.
